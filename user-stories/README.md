# ðŸ§¾ User Stories â€“ Airbnb Clone

This document captures the **core user stories** derived from the **use case diagram** created in Task 2 of the Airbnb Clone backend project.

## âœ¨ Purpose

User stories are short, simple descriptions of features told from the perspective of the person who desires the new functionality â€” usually a user or administrator of the system.

These stories help bridge the gap between technical implementation and user expectations.

## ðŸ“‹ Included Stories

The file `user-stories.md` includes:
- Guest interactions (registration, booking, payments, reviews)
- Host interactions (property listing, booking history)
- Admin interactions (user and listing management)
- System behavior (notifications, payouts)
